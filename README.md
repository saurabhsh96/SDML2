# SDML2 (For course SDM)
Far field evaluation of elementary dipoles with various stratified media configuration

SDML1 figures out spectral green's function of various configurations of stratified media. 
This code evaluates the far field from these elementary dipoles in these configurations.

Details of routines described in Matlab Instruction-2 file.
